Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- Welcome to tolkien.freenode.net in Sanford, NC, US. Thanks to
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- https://travelingmailbox.com/ for sponsoring this server
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- software communities since 1998.
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	-  
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- By connecting to freenode you indicate that you have read and
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- accept our policies and guidelines as set out on https://freenode.net
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	-  
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- In the event that you observe behaviour that contravenes our policies,
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- please notify a volunteer staff member via private message, or send us an
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- e-mail to complaints@freenode.net -- we will do our best to address the
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- situation within a reasonable period of time, and we may request further
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- information or, as appropriate, involve other parties such as channel operators 
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- Group Contacts representing an on-topic group.
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	-  
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- freenode runs an open proxy scanner.

Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- volunteer staff on '/stats p' (shows only on-call staff) or by joining 
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- #freenode and using the '/who freenode/staff/*' command. You may message
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- any of us at any time. Please note that freenode predominantly provides 
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- assistance via private message, and while we have a network channel the 
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- primary venue for support requests is via private message to a member

Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- From time to time, volunteer staff may send server-wide notices relating to

Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- will be sent as wallops, and you can '/mode <yournick> +w' to ensure that you
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as
Sep 23 10:22:52 *	- global notices.
